UFC Project for CareerFoundry

This is an Open Data Source that is free and available to the public and found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajeevw/ufcdata.
The collection was done administratively by the UFC and then organized by an outside source into the data frame available
at the website already listed.  The data consisted of every fight in the UFC from 1994 to 2023 and provide statistics from
each fight including location, date, and other fight related statistics.  The original JSON file for the geographical visualization
can be found at https://geojson-maps.ash.ms/.  I created a Tableau Presentation which can be found at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jake.upchurch/viz/UFCProject_17059507437020/UFCStory.  However, the Tableau presenation only
contains relevant files and not each step in my analysis.
